        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Time Zone</h2>
        <p>
          Bali is in the Central Indonesia Time (WITA) time zone: + 08:00 hour
          GMT/UTC.

        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Season and Weather</h2>
        <p>
          Bali is located just a few degrees south of the equator. It has a
          tropical climate with sunshine all year round and tends to be hot and
          humid all along the year. Rainy season usually starts from November to
          March, and a relatively dry season often occurs from April to October;
          however, some showers can still occur, so it is better to always
          prepare umbrellas and raincoats. In the rainy season, it usually rains
          a couple of hours in the morning or in the afternoon, while for the
          rest of the day, it has sunshine for a few hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Temperatures are high and uniform throughout the year. They are
          slightly higher from October to March and the temperatures can reach
          30°C, with the daily average at around 27 °C (81 °F). They are a bit
          lower from June to September, when the daily average is around 26 °C
          (79 °F). In the rainy season, there is muggy heat due to high
          humidity.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Transportation</h2>
        <p>
          In Bali there are many ways of transportation for you to travel easily
          from one place to another. You can rent bicycles, motorbikes, or cars.
          You also can take a conventional taxi (Blue Bird) or you can also find
          a car and driver who will also be your guide. Tell the driver your
          desired route and negotiate a fee. An important virtue to have while
          on the road in Bali is patience! Although the road system in the
          heavily populated areas is quite reasonable (condition wise), it can
          also be highly congested at peak periods. Ceremonial processions often
          take up the entire road so if you are caught behind a procession,
          enjoy the colorful experience.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Currency and Bank Services</h2>
        <p>
          For transactions, the Balinese people use Rupiah (Rp) as the official
          currency. The applicable banknotes here start from Rp1,000, Rp2,000,
          Rp5,000, Rp10,000, Rp20,000, Rp50,000, and Rp100,000 as the largest
          value. While the value of coins is Rp100, Rp200, Rp500, and Rp1,000.
        </p>
        <p>
          Banks are open from Monday to Friday, generally from 8:00am to 2:00pm.
          ATMs (cash machines) work 24 hours a day. All banks close at weekends
          and on public holidays. There are plenty of currency exchange offices,
          banks, and cash machines throughout the city.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Language</h2>
        <p>
          Balinese people use Indonesian and Balinese to communicate with each
          other. The most common foreign language used here is English.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Electric, Socket, Plug, Adapters</h2>
        <p>
          The socket models that you will find in Bali are models C and F. This
          type has two cylindrical connection legs designed which is the
          standard European plug. A universal plug would also suffice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The standard voltage throughout Indonesia is normally 230 V and with a
          standard frequency of 50 Hz. If you are from the UK, Europe, Australia
          and most of Asia or Africa, most of your phones, laptops and other
          gadgets could be charged like normal. However, if you come from
          countries like the United States, Canada, and most South American
          countries, the range of voltage differs in Indonesia.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Internet and connectivity</h2>
        <p>
          In order to keep internet connection running smoothly, you should
          choose a prepaid local SIM (Subscriber Identification Module) card.
          With Rp100,000 you can get various types of internet quota,so that you
          can stay online for a month. You can get a SIM card in a local
          merchant available almost everywhere. The Wi-Fi connection is usually
          available at hotels, restaurants, or large shopping centers.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Telephone</h2>
        <p>
          The international dialing code from abroad to an Indonesian number is
          +62.
        </p>
        <p>
          For international calls, dial 00 + national code + area code +
          personal number. Mobile phone network coverage is available across
          Indonesian and relatively good across Bali.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Emergency Number</h2>
        <p>Emergency: 112</p>
        <p>Ambulance: 118</p>
        <p>Police: 110</p>
        <p>Fire Department: 113</p>
        <p>
          When contacting the important numbers above, please use the country
          code and area code. You can start by pressing +62 (0) for the
          Indonesian country code, then press – 361 for the Bali region code.
          Then continue pressing the destination number, for example – 112.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Ground Transportation and Security</h2>
        <p>
          Taxis (Blue Bird group) are the most convenient way of getting around
          and can be hailed or pre-booked. However, hiring a car and driver for
          the day works out more efficiently. Most car rentals are provided by
          professional companies that use late model vehicles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The convention centers in Nusa Dua have a fully integrated security
          system, which is manned 24 hours a day by trained and friendly
          security personnel. With security checkpoint gates, the Nusa Dua area
          is one of the most secure tourist districts in Bali.
